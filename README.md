# Scrimbafy: Product Splash Page

This project is a responsive product splash page for "Scrimbafy," a fictional service that turns your picture into an iconic Scrimba-style avatar. Built as a key module in the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path, this project demonstrates how to build a beautiful, modern, and fully responsive landing page.


## About The Project

This is a single-page static website built with plain HTML and CSS. It's fully responsive and focuses on modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox, responsive units, and a mobile-first workflow. The goal was to build a realistic and visually appealing marketing page, without relying on any frameworks.

## Built With

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)

## What I Learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to master the fundamentals of building responsive, real-world websites.

-   **Responsive Layouts & Flexbox:** I learned to create flexible containers that adapt to different screen sizes. I gained deep experience with Flexbox, including `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and using the `order` property to change the visual layout of elements without altering the HTML structure.

-   **Mobile-First Design:** I practiced building the site for mobile screens first and then using `min-width` media queries to add complexity and adjust the layout for wider screens. This included creating and managing common breakpoints.

-   **Modern CSS Units (`rem`, `em`, `%`, `vh`):** I learned the difference between various CSS units and when to use each one for maximum flexibility and scalability.
    -   `rem` for font sizes and global spacing.
    -   `em` for spacing relative to the current font size.
    -   Percentages (`%`) for fluid container widths.
    -   Viewport units (`vh`, `vw`) for creating full-height hero sections.

-   **Styling & Typography:** I learned to style all the core components of a product page, including text, buttons, and form inputs. This included text transformations, adjusting line length for readability, and creating accessible `:focus` states for interactive elements.

-   **Box Model Mastery:** I learned why `box-sizing: border-box` is essential for creating predictable layouts and how it simplifies managing element dimensions with padding and borders.
